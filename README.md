# spark-single-user-rs

This project can be used to perform the experimentation with ALS recommendation.
The proyect can be cloned and compiled with the following commands:
git clone git@github.com:jcastro-inf/spark-single-user-rs.git
cd spark-single-user-rs
mvn clean package

These commands generate a jar file located in target/ named original-spark-single-user-rs-1.0.jar that we will use to submit the job to spark:
```bash
spark-submit \
	--master $SPARK_MASTER \
	--class es.jcastro.delfos.scala.Main \
	target/original-spark-single-user-rs-1.0.jar \
	--input $DATASET \
	--implicitFeedback
```
```
Parameters:
	--master             sets the url of the spark master.
	--class              specifies the entry point of the program.
	--input              specifies the file of the dataset used for the recommendations
	--implicitFeedback   flag to mark the dataset as implicit, thus using implicit als and
                       ignoring rating value in the dataset file, if present.
```

This command needs to be adjusted to match the cluster configuration. Here, there is an example of their values:
```bash
SPARK_MASTER="spark://127.0.0.1:7077"
DATASET="~/ml-100k/u.data"
```

The algorithm expects the dataset to be a tab separated file in which each line contains an user identifier (integer number), an item identifier. If the file contains more fields, they are ignored.
